# Modified Enclosure Panels for the V-Core 4.0

## Bed Plane Frame Squaring (BPFS)

The stock rear panel has a two 11mm holes, each one providing access to the quick connector at each end of the rear 3030 crossbar that supports the XY stepper motors. These holes allow the quick connector to be loosened when fine tuning the gantry skew. The holes are only provided in the rear panel on the basis that the adjustment is performed when only the rear panel is in place, and removing the rear panel and associated wiring would be impractical.

The BPFS mods add quick connector access holes to the side panels and elongate some of the panel fixing screw holes into slots so that the bed plane can be adjusted with the side panels attached and without risk that the panel fixing screws might restrict the necessary adjustment range (rear and side panels). The front and top panels are unchanged and so are not included in this repo.

The side panels are identical but no longer vertically symmetrical as they were in the original design. Left and right versions are provided, one is just the reflection of the other. This only matters if you care about which side of your panel material faces inwards - for example, if the sheet has a different colour back and front. If there's no difference (for example, clear polycarbonate) then you can just get two cuts of the left one (or the right one, it doesn't matter).

Important: these mods have not been tested yet. However, the changes are minor and will have no functional impact even if it turns out they are pointless. The additional side panel holes towards the rear of the printer are blocked on the inside by extrusions and could easily be plugged with a printed cover on the outside if desired for cosmetic purposes. Anyhow, getting panels cut from these DXFs is entirely your own decision and at your own risk!
