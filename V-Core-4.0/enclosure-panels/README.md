# Modified Enclosure Panels for the V-Core 4.0

## Bed Plane Frame Squaring (BPFS)

The stock rear panel has a two 11mm holes, each one providing access to the quick connector at each end of the rear 3030 crossbar that supports the XY stepper motors. At the time of writing, the build guide has not yet been published and the purpose of these two access holes has not been explained.

The BPFS mods follow from the assumption that these access holes are intended to allow squaring of the frame to create a flat bed plane with the rear panel attached. The BPFS mods add quick connector access holes to the side panels and elongate some of the panel fixing screw holes into slots so that the bed plane can be adjusted with the panels attached and without the panel fixing screws restricting the necessary adjustment range (rear and side panels). The front and top panels are unchanged and so are not included in this repo.

The side panels are identical but no longer vertically symmetrical as they were in the original design. Left and right versions are provided, one is just the reflection of the other. This only matters if you care about which side of your panel material faces inwards - for example, if the sheet has a different colour back and front. If there's no difference (for example, clear polycarbonate) then you can just get two cuts of the left one (or the right one, it doesn't matter).

I've created these mods for those who want or need to order their cut panels asap.

Important: these mods have not been tested, and are based purely on a theoretical assumption. However, the changes are minor and will have no functional impact even if it turns out they are pointless. The additional side panel holes towards the rear of the printer are blocked on the inside by extrusions and could easily be plugged with a printed cover on the outside if desired for cosmetic purposes. Anyhow, getting panels cut from these DXFs is entirely your own decision and at your own risk!
